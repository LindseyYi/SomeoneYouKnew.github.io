    <h2><b>Bio:</b> Salutations. I am a regular hooman specimen living on the planet known as earth. I have no idea on what to do with my life :D</h2>
    <p></p>
    
    <p><b>Likes:</b> The fact that our world will be gone in the next century or so :D <br>
      <b>Dislikes:</b> My Life :D <br>
    </p>
    
      <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Most people cannot tickle themselves when they are awake and in a normal state. However, they CAN tickle themselves when they are asleep or hypnotized. Good luck trying, I guess? This actually has absolutely nothing to do with me personally, I just thought it was interesting.<br></p>
